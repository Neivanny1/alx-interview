# 0x05. N Queens
The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.
## Tasks
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
One solution per line
Format: see example
You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
You are only allowed to import the sys module
## Concepts Needed:
### Backtracking Algorithms:

Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

### Recursion:
Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
Recursion in Python
### List Manipulations in Python:

Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
Python Lists
### Python Command Line Arguments:

Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
