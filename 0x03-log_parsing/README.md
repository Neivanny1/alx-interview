## 0x03-log_parsing learning objectives
# For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. 

# Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:
# Concepts Needed:
1. File I/O in Python:
2. Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
3. Python Input and Output
4. Signal Handling in Python:
5. Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
6. Python Signal Handling
7. Data Processing:
    Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
    Aggregating data to compute summaries.
8. Regular Expressions:
    Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
    Python Regular Expressions
9. Dictionaries in Python:
    Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
    Python Dictionaries
10. Exception Handling:
    Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
    Python Exceptions 
# By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
