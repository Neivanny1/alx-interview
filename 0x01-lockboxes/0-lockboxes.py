Task

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
boxes is a list of lists
A key with the same number as a box opens that box
You can assume all keys will be positive integers
There can be keys that do not have boxes
The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False

def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    if (type(boxes) is not list):
        return False
    if (len(boxes) == 0):
        return False
    keys = [0]
    for i in keys:
        for j in boxes[i]:
            if j not in keys and j != i and j < len(boxes) and j != 0:
                keys.append(j)
    if len(keys) == len(boxes):
        return True
    else:
        return False
